Malpractice
===========

12/18/2014

What a pretty heart attack!
Give me the breakdown
No, let me guess, a lack of sex
and daily dose of cigarettes
spells cardiac arrest?

Now the crash and the darkness
And the reaper can be seen
Sitting in the waiting room
And reading magazines

Now the chest will resist
Between a voltage source and ground
Now the cough and the gasp
And a vocal, epiphanic sound
