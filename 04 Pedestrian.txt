12/2014 - 1/2015

The purple bricks of Kendall Square
Seem to shimmer when in shadow
Sometimes leaves fall, and they are that color
But not from trees in Kendall Square

The hum that shoots down Vassar Street
And the pressure in that corridor
And the math in the air
What an unholy geometry

[[something goes here hat I need to work on]]

On New Year's Day, 2015,
The troops are already re-budding.
Some are young; some are old; all will fare well
I take notes from the arbor at Longfellow House
Where these trees can be seen in the Garden
A flock of some hundreds takes off, as I leave,
From the Leslie lawn to the east
They circle round overhead once, undecided,
Then settle down up in the trees
