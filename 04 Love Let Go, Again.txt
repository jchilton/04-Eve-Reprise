Love Let Go, Again
==================

12/28/2014

Your aura is the color of neon
You are so full of life, hope and love
I want you more than the stars and sun
Because we fit together like hand in glove

Everyone says love is steady
That's why I didn't complain
When you continued homeward on the bus
And I had to connect on the train

There's really no distance between us
As long as you feel the same way
I will be calm and as loud as I can
So that maybe you'll hear me someday

Love at first sight is an earthquake
Which rends open faults in the heart
When we meet due to blind serendipity
Then with purpose in mind must we part

Sometimes I cry for no reason
Such is what others must see
When I walk through town with tears on my cheeks
The catharsis which sets us all free

Some don't know how to enjoy it
They cling to grief, anger and fear
The poisonous thoughts that enslave us
With antidote inside the tear

The truth is these aren't even my tears
They're sadness from neighbors of mine
Who don't yet know just quite how to let go
But will in the end turn out just fine

I miss you
