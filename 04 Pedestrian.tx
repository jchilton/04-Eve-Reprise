Pedestrian
==========

12/2014 - 1/2015

The purple bricks of Kendall Square
Seem to shimmer when in shadow
Sometimes leaves fall, and they are that color
But not from trees in Kendall Square

The hum that shoots down Vassar Street
And the pressure in that corridor
And the math in the air
What an unholy geometry
